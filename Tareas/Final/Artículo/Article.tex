\section{Introduction}

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational
attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth’s neighborhood. Composed
mostly of water ice with embedded dust particles, comets originally formed in the cold outer planetary
system while most of the rocky asteroids formed in the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter.  \supercite{nasaBasics}

A meteoroid is generally defined as an asteroid or comet fragment that orbits the Sun and has an
approximate size between ten microns and a meter or so. Meteors, or "shooting stars", are the visible
paths of meteoroids that have entered the Earth’s atmosphere at high velocities. A fireball is an
unusually bright meteor that reaches a visual magnitude of $-3$ or brighter when seen at the observer’s
zenith. \supercite{nasaFireballs}

Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are small bodies of the Solar System with perihelion distance $q$
$1.3\:AU$ (Astronomical Units) and aphelion distances $Q$ $0.983\:AU$, whose orbits approach or
intersect Earth orbit. The NEAs are classified into three main classes: Apollo, Amor and Aten on the
basis of derived orbital parameters. \supercite{rukmini2016statistical}

Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are a special subset of NEAs that, according to The Center for
Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), have an absolute magnitude ($H$) of $22.0$ or less that can come
close to the Earth and are large enough to cause significant damage in the event of an impact. \supercite{zhou2024martians}

Sentry is a highly automated collision monitoring system that continually scans the most current
asteroid catalog for possibilities of future impact with Earth over the next 100 years. Whenever a
potential impact is detected it will be analyzed and the results immediately published here, except
in unusual cases where we seek independent confirmation. \supercite{nasaSentryEarth}

\section{Data and Methods}

The data about fireballs, NEOs, NEAs and impact probabilities have been collected from the database of
The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) and its monitoring system Sentry. The parameters
studied include absolute visual magnitude ($H$), impact probability, impact energy ($kt$) and
geographic location of fireball objects.

% To analyze these data it was used a Gaussian distribution fit, correlation coefficients such as
% Pearson's and Spearman's and a graphical representation of geographic locations with it's respective
% impact enegry as the size of the reported events. In addition, some information was used as logarithm
% due to its large range.

To determine if the impact energy ($kt$) of fireballs is consistent with some type of distribution it
was decided to use the logarithm of the data and then a histogram was made with the counts of the
impact energy ($log(kt)$) in intervals of $0.2$. With these data, some distribution fit were applied
to confirm wich one was more accurate.

\begin{figure*} % Two column figure (notice the starred environment)
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fireballs.png}
	\caption{Fireballs reported by US government sensors from April 15, 1988, to May 15, 2024. The size and color of each circle were determined by the logarithm of the impact energy (kt), and the location was determined by the altitude and longitude. All this data was obtained from the database published by NASA’s CNEOS at JPL.}
	\label{fig:fireballs}
\end{figure*}

At first, the covariance matrix was used to find the linear bond between NEOs' absolute magnitude ($H$)
and impact probability, but due to the correlation not being linear, it was discarded. Then proceeded
to use Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients to analyze better the data and determine if a
correlation existed and which type it was.

At last, using Gnuplot and Python with various libraries such as pandas, numpy, plotly, a graphic
representation of geographic locations with their respective impact energy as the size of the reported
events was made.

Here there goes the results

	\caption{Histogram of the logarithm of fireballs' impact energy ($kt$) reported by US government sensors from April 15, 1988, to May 15, 2024. The red line indicates the fit of a Gaussian distribution that was applied to the data. The larger impact energy was of $6\:log(kt)$.}
